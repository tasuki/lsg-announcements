# LSG announcements

## Dependencies

On Debian-ish systems...

### TeX

`sudo apt install texlive texlive-xetex texlive-lang-polish`

### Inkscape

`sudo apt install inkscape`

### Pdfunite

`sudo apt install poppler-utils`

### Ammonite REPL

Tested with 2.3.8, quite likely to work with whatever.

Favourite install method, pipe a random script from the internet to your shell: https://ammonite.io/

## Use

There's a messy makefile, doesn't have make all, run the targets separately.
